HELP! I need some Javac, HELP! not just any Javac, HELP! gotta get my code to run, HELLLLLLP


Running Photomanager from Git Bash

1) Ensure javac is in your path, you can check this by entering

>echo $PATH 

in your git bash.

If javac is in your path proceed to 2) otherwise proceed to 1b).



1b) In this case you do not currently have javac in your path, but fear not!

First locate your JDK and find the path to the bin folder. The JDK is typically

located under C/users/programfiles/java on Windows Machines. Once you have the path 

run the following command

>export PATH=$PATH:"/your-path-here/bin/"

this command will add javac to your path.



2) Next cd into the group_0451/phase1/src/main/java folder in your git bash.

Enter the following command

>javac -classpath .;../../../res/*.jar -D com/PhotoManager/GUInterface.java

the command should exit upon execution, it may suggest recompiling with xlint

but this is unnecessary.



3) Now you're ready to rock! While located in the source folder enter

>java PhotoManager.GUInterface 

and the program will run!
