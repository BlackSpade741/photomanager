# Phase 1 Design Questions

Q: Which part(s) of the program are responsible for reading the contents of the
starting directory?

	ConfigManager

Q: What happens when a new tag is created?

	It is added to the File object Tags and history and then sent to Directory to update 
	  the old logData which then gets sent to ConfigManager to be written to the 
	  config.

Q: Which class is keeping track of the association between tags and files?

	File

Q: How will files be moved to a new folder?

	Directory will get a File from Tree in folder 1 and remove it from that Tree's arrayList and then move it to to the new Tree representing the 
	  folder to move it to. Then move the physical File in the OS's directory to the file that the new Tree represents. If folder does not exist in
	  the OS's directory, make a new Tree and folder in the OS's directory.

Q: How will tags persist between executions?

	Tags will be stored in the 1st line of the config file. Tags on Files are to be added to the end of the OS's directory versions of the Files.

Q: How will all the renaming be logged.

	After any renaming, the old name, new name, time stamp, and associated File will be sent to the Directory's logData to add it to the ArrayList for that File.

Q: How will history be logged?
